# React Sortable

Sortable component for ReactJS

# Notes

It does not follow the facebook's recommendations (not built with flux).

For better, well design drag & drop plugin (with sortable demo), take a look at [react-dnd](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd/).

# Roadmap

- Allow sorting of items inside a grid layout
- Add handle property
